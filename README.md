Electroneum GUI is was one of my first attempts at using Electron to create a cross-platform application.

The aim of the app is to provide the user with a GUI Wallet for the Electroneum Blockchain. It requires the user to either have access to an Electroneum Node remotely or locally (locally requires some additional technical knowledge)
